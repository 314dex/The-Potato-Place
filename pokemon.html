    <div class="blog-post"><h2>Why Mind Reader can actually become a goood move</h2><br><br>
      <h3>We all know Mind Reader to be a pretty useless move. however, Articuno could use mind reader to its fullest extent.
      The move Sheer Cold does a OHKO. However it has a 30% accuracy. Therefore, using mind reader, Articuno can use Mind Reader, so it would never miss,
      and then use sheer cold to finish off the pokemon. However, if the pokemon has the ability sturdy, it is not advised to use Articuno, for the rock type move
        will kill the articun, it being an Ice/Flying type.</h3><br>

      <h3>As you may know, Pokemons are evil aliendss that are trying to take over the world. We also know that Donald Trunp is trying to stop them.
          Unfortunately people didn't like Trump because of the wall.
        But what people don't know is that the pokemon managed to hypnotize him so they can exist and kill the people in this world.
        The one pokemon who is controlling everyone is obviouly Pikachu. And he is indeed, a horse.</h3><br>
