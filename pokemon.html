    <div class="blog-post"><h2>Why Mind Reader can actually become a goood move</h2><br><br>
      <h3>We all know Mind Reader to be a pretty useless move. however, Articuno could use mind reader to its fullest extent.
      The move Sheer Cold does a OHKO. However it has a 30% accuracy. Therefore, using mind reader, Articuno can use Mind Reader, so it would never miss,
      and then use sheer cold to finish off the pokemon. However, if the pokemon has the ability sturdy, it is not advised to use Articuno, for the rock type move
        will kill the articun, it being an Ice/Flying type.</h3><br>

  <div class="blog-post"><h2>Pokémon Go's Rhydon<br>
    <br></h2><h3> Pokemon Go has definately made Rhydon too OP. Usually if you use a Vaporeon on a Rhydon, it's good-bye Rhydon, right? Wrong.
  Even if Rhydon and Vaporeon are the same CP(ex. CP2476), Rhydon has a pretty good chance of killing the Vaporeon. Plus, Rhydon can even murder a Dragonite with
  Mud Slap. In actual pokemon, that move would have no effect on Dragonite whatsoever. So a note to Niantic, please change Rhydon.</h3><br>
