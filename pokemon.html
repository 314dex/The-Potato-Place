  <span><h3>Pokémon Go's Rhydon<br> Pokemon Go has definately made Rhydon too OP. Usually if you use a Vaporeon on a Rhydon, it's good-bye Rhydon, right? Wrong.
  Even if Rhydon and Vaporeon are the same CP(ex. CP2476), Rhydon has a pretty good chance of killing the Vaporeon. Plus, Rhydon can even murder a Dragonite with
  Mud Slap. In actual pokemon, that move would have no effect on Dragonite whatsoever. So a note to Niantic, please change Rhydon.</h3><br>
